//    Create a controller specific for the professor resource
//    Make it so that we can:
//    Create a new professor.
//    Get all the professors.
//    Get the professor for a given id.
//    Update an existing professor (an id is provided) with a new set of data.
//    Delete an existing professor for a given id.
//    Create a specific service and the required domain objects to succeed in these requirements
//    A professor consists of an:
//    id
//            firstname
//    lastname
//    Try to make use of DTO's (and dedicated mappers to map those DTO's from and to your domain objects).
//
//    Furthermore, think about edge-cases, e.g.:
//
//    What if we try to update a professor, but could not find a professor for the provided id...?
