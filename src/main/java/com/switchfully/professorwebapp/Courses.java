public class Courses {
//    Implement the following requirements:
//
//    Create a controller specific for the courses resource
//    Make it so that we can:
//    Create a new course.
//    Get all courses
//    Additionally, using a query parameter, we should be able to filter on study points of a course.
//            E.g. 'get the courses that have 6 study points'
//    When the query parameter is not defined, all courses should be returned
//
//    Create a specific service and the required domain objects to succeed in these requirements
//    A course consists of an:
//    id
//            name
//    amount of study points (integer values ranging from 1 to 6)
//    an (existing) professor (either include only the professor's id, or include the full professor object)

//    object-based:
//    Professor profFreddy = profRepo.getById(providedProfessorId);
//    new Course ("IT essentials", 6.0, profFreddy);

//    identity-based:
//            new Course ("IT essentials", 6.0, 100); // where 100 is the id of a professor

//    Try to make use of DTO's (and dedicated mappers to map those DTO's from and to your domain objects).
//
//    Furthermore, think about edge-cases, e.g.:
//
//    What if we try to create a course, but the professor id could not be found...?
